# About the project:

___"Hell's Kitchen"___ is my own pet project. It's a multiplayer game for PC and consoles with the ability to play up to four people. It is reminiscent of Overcooked2

___Players___ are given the opportunity to create public and private lobbies. There is also a waiting room for players and the game it self is synchronized. 

___The game___ has customizable controls that allow players to configure controls on both the keyboard and gamepads. 

___The single game___ mode is also present. If the player wants to play without a net and one, he can do it.
